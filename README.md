# Arch PHP Framework

**Built for Scale. Engineered for Speed. Secured by Design.**

Arch is a modern, high-performance, security-first PHP framework focused exclusively on building robust backend systems and scalable APIs. Powered by the lightweight `Nitro` core, Arch offers an elegant developer experience without sacrificing performance, simplicity, or security.

---

## 🚀 Why Arch?

- **Pure PHP** – Written from scratch with zero external dependencies.
- **Lightning-Fast Core** – Optimized for low latency and high throughput.
- **Secure by Default** – Enforces strong defaults and follows modern security practices.
- **Developer-Centric** – Simple, expressive, and extensible architecture.
- **Framework-Level Scaling** – Designed to support growing teams, large codebases, and high-concurrency environments.

## 🧱 Core Philosophy

Arch is not a general-purpose framework. It is purpose-built for **backend systems**, **microservices**, and **API platforms** that need to scale predictably and perform reliably under heavy load.

> "If it doesn’t serve the backend, it doesn’t belong in Arch."

## 📦 Installation

Coming soon via Composer:

```bash
composer create-project phicorp/arch my-app

```

> `nova` is the built-in CLI tool that controls your application.

## 🛡 Security

Arch is engineered with a **security-first mindset**. From input sanitization to HTTPS enforcement, from CSRF handling to encrypted secrets — every layer of the stack is carefully hardened.

✅ Supports **PASETO**  
✅ Isolated environments with strict config loading  
✅ No accidental exposure of sensitive data
